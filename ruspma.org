* General Information
** About Ruspma
   - What is Ruspma?
     - It stands for ruby lisp machine learning
       and meaning it just contains any random stuff
       I feel like implementing.
   - What is the ultimate goal?
     - No real goal except as a general place to build
       off of previous attempts at writing algoritms.
** About Languages
*** About Grand Lisp Varient Zero
    - What is Grand Lisp Varient Zero?
      - It is a joke and at the same time not.
       The name does not imply that it is a
       "better" lisp (which it is not), but
       that it is built for Aiding in intelligent
       and grand systems. The zero implies that
       it is the first in an array of "grand"
       lisps along with making it sound fancier.
    - What is the goal of Grand Lisp Varient Zero?
      - To build a lisp based off of Common Lisp
       that is integrated with modern machine
       learning techniques and classical 
       artificial inteligence. Also so that 
       it is actually fun to write inteligent and
       efficient systems in a scalable fashion
       with concern of power and simplicity
       over a shallow learning curve. Also
       to have a human readable lisp ontop
       of the genetic programming languages
       ruspma uses.
*** About Plantain Scheme
    - What is Plantain Scheme?
      - It is a joke and also very serious.
	It is by no means Banana Scheme
	(http://esolangs.org/wiki/Banana_Scheme)
	although it is designed with the 
	"impossible" goal of being a
	decent genetic programming language.
